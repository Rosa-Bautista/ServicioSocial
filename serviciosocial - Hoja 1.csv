1,MGYS00000633,PRJNA63661,Intestinal microbiota of preterm infants differ over time and between hospitals.,"The microbial composition of the gut likely contributes to a wide-range of health and disease states including intestinal inflammation, atopic disease, and possibly diseases of adulthood, such as heart disease and obesity. The early establishment of the gut microflora is suspected to have a particularly profound impact protecting the gut from infectious disease and on long-term subsequent health by predisposing individuals to atopic or autoimmune disease later in life. In contrast to the large-scale efforts of the Human Microbiome Project to characterize the microbial flora of healthy adults, relatively little has been accomplished to characterize the early establishment of the microbiota in infants.",5645,human gut,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA63661,mgnify,

A microbial element of the condition has been confirmed, however exact aetiology remains enigmatic and ‘typical’ microbiota development remains undefined. To characterise establishment of the severely preterm infant gut microbiota we employed targeted sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Sample types included oral and endotracheal swabs, stool and breast milk, collected from 7 patients over the first 2 months, postnatally (n = 158 samples)",683,"oral and endotracheal swabs, stool and breast milk",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/studies/MGYS00002586#overview,mgnify,

Recruitment took place between September 2008 and May 2010 in Estonia and Finland, and between September 2008 and July 2011 in Russia. Follow-up was completed in April 2013 in Estonia and Finland, and in October 2013 in Russia. The final number of children included in the present study was 74 from each country. Inclusion criteria included positive cord blood testing for HLA DR-DQ alleles conferring increased risk for autoimmunity.

12,MGYS00004712,PRJEB28097,(1) Personalized microbiome and host features resist gut mucosal colonization by empiric probiotics; (2) Post-antibiotic gut mucosal microbiome reconstitution is impaired by probiotics and improved by autologous FMT,"Abstract (1):Empiric probiotics are commonly consumed in healthy individuals as means of life quality improvement and disease prevention. However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo, demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured a person-, region- and microbial-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by differential baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, highly-individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches.Abstract (2):Probiotics are widely prescribed for prevention of antibiotics-associated dysbiosis and related adverse effects. However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa, but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently-incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and gut transcriptome recovery to steady-state configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In-vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised microbiome and host recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection, without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host.",5358,sistema digestivo,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/studies/MGYS00004712#overview,mgnify,

Infants from Finland and Estonia were recruited at birth based on HLA risk genotyping. Parents collected their infants' stool at approximately monthly intervals and promptly stored the sample in the freezer prior to shipment for sample processing and sequencing.
